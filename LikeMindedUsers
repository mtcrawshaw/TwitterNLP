Takes as input the screen name of a user Main
Calculates the opinion vector of Main
Gets list of users who have tweeted in the last 24 hours (time window subject to change due to computation time?)
Calculate opinion vectors of first 5 users on list, distance to Main, put them in Map screen name -> distance
For each other user U on list, calculate opinion vector + euclidean distance to main, place in top 5 if close enough
Return top 5

When you come back:
Implement getTweets() method in OpinionatedUser
Make main method that takes input of screen name, generates list of users, finds the closest, and outputs them
